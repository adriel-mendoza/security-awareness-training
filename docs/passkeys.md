# How to Enable Passkeys on iPhone and Android

Passkeys are a secure and convenient way to sign in to apps and websites without using traditional passwords. They use biometric authentication like Face ID, Touch ID, or a device passcode to verify your identity.

## Enabling Passkeys on iPhone

1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
2. Tap Passwords.
3. Select Password Options.
4. Toggle on AutoFill Passwords and Passkeys.
5. Ensure iCloud Passwords & Keychain is enabled under the "Use Passwords and Passkeys From" section.
6. Navigate to a website or app that supports passkeys and follow the prompts to create and save a passkey.

## Enabling Passkeys on Android

1. Open the Settings app on your Android device.
2. Tap Passwords, passkeys & accounts.
3. Toggle on the password manager you want to use for passkeys (e.g., Google Password Manager).
4. Navigate to a website or app that supports passkeys and follow the prompts to create and save a passkey.

## Troubleshooting Common Passkey Issues

- **Passkey not working**: Ensure your device's biometric authentication or PIN is functioning correctly. Try removing and re-adding the passkey.

- **No passkeys available**: Make sure you are using a compatible device and browser. Log out and back in, or clear your browser cache.

- **Passkey already exists**: This error occurs if a passkey for the same account already exists. Try deleting the existing passkey and creating a new one.

- **Unable to save passkey**: Ensure iCloud Keychain (for iPhone) or the appropriate password manager (for Android) is enabled.

- **General errors**: Restart your device and ensure it is updated to the latest software version. If issues persist, consult the support documentation for your device or password manager.
